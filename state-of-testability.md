# State of Testability

## Existing Test Coverage
- **Unit tests** verify small pieces of logic such as `ReportGenerator.Generate` and `ReportExporter.Export`.
- **Characterization tests** capture current flawed behavior like malformed JSON output and exceptions from `SmsNotification`.
- **Integration tests** exercise interactions with the file system and database when saving and exporting reports.
- **End-to-end tests** execute the console application and assert that a completion message is written.

## Observations
- Many components such as `UserManager` and `OrderProcessor` depend directly on external systems (SMTP servers, file system paths, SQLite), making them difficult to isolate or mock.
- `ReportGenerator.SaveReport` performs file and database operations without abstraction, which complicates error handling and testing.
- `SendReport` and user creation routines rely on network resources; tests avoid these paths to prevent side effects.
- Interfaces like `IMultiFunctionDevice` force unnecessary implementations, reducing testability for simple devices.

Overall, while basic behaviors are covered, significant parts of the software remain hard to test due to tight coupling and side effects.
