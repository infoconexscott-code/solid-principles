# SOLID Principles

This folder contains deep dives into each of the SOLID principles. The acronym was introduced by [Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) (Uncle Bob). Each document includes:

- A brief description of the principle.
- A C# example that **violates** the principle.
- A refactored example that **fixes** the violation with an explanation.
